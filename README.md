# Beginners Course in Python

Hi, and welcome to my beginners course in Python. I hope you find this useful! If you have any questions, please look through the [issues for this repository](https://github.com/MartinJrgsn/learn-python/issues). If your question has been answered, feel free to [Create a New Issue](https://github.com/MartinJrgsn/learn-python/issues/new/choose). Please describe your question in as much detail as you can, and if there is anything that I have written that might need to be expanded upon, please let me know which section, and I will do my best to address the issue.

Python is a high-level programming language with a not too steep learning curve due to its syntax. The syntax is how you "formulate your lines of code". It is written in the english language, and with some experience you can learn to read other people's code, understand what it does, and how to recreate similar functionality.

## Development Environment

The first step in learning Python is to install and setup your development environment. Of course, you can write your code in any simple text editor (E.g. [gedit](https://gedit-text-editor.org/), [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)). However, this is not what I would recommend. Using a development environment that fits your needs will help you in writing and testing your Python scripts, and it is also incredibly helpful when it comes to understanding, debugging, and formatting your code.

There are many different options to choose from. Below you can find a list of development environments I have used, and had good experiences with.

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
- [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Throughout this course the plan is to rely on what Anaconda provides. Anaconda comes with the option to install and run amongst other things, Jupyter Notebook and Spyder, and it also has a base environment with most, if not all the Python libraries you will need from the get-go. Any additional libraries we might require will come with an installation instruction.

To avoid any confusion or frustration in configuring and using any other development environments, please follow the link to Anaconda, download the Anaconda Installer for your operating system, run the installer, and complete the installation.

Once Anaconda is installed, launch Anaconda Navigator, and continue to [Section 1](Section%201).
